# ML_practicalwork

The purpose of this practical session is to implement a first machine learning model on a regression problem using RidgeRegression and `sklearn`. The dataset we used is the california housing dataset since well known boston house dataset as ethical issues.

This dataset consists in a description of houses by 8 features, each house being associated to a measure of its price. The goal here is to predict the price of an house given its description.
